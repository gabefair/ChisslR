# 1. Introduction
### Main objective: End-to-end data exploration and analysis app for the 20-newsgroups data

The 20_newsgroups_app provides functionality to explore the raw data, the sentiments expressed in a selected topic, the topic models for checking the data categories and overlap, and provides the chisslR functionality to train a model dynamically while exploring misclassified data.

We wanted to make this app to address industry needs to look at text data from start to finish to perform data analysis. The app addresses 3 objectives:
1. Helps explore data, visualize baseline classification and displays misclassified samples
2. Helps dynamically label misclassified samples
3. Helps improve learning by providing updated labels to model

# 2. Data operation and abstraction design
We used data from http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/. We used tidyverse to clean and visualize the data. 

# 3. Interaction design

# 4. Algorithmic design

# 5. User Evaluation

# 6. Future work

# 7. Appendix
